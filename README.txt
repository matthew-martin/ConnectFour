This project was created for the ECS 170 (Artificial Intelligence) class in Winter of 2017. This is one of the major projects for the class.
The assignment was to create an AI module that plays connect four. The AI most choose a move within a strict time limit (less than half a second for the tournament). The AI module must operate by using a game tree to perform a Minimax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax> operation to determine the "best" move at a given time. After a Minimax AI is developed, alpha-beta pruning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning> is implemented to optimize the game tree search operation.
After each individual or group created their AI, all modules were played against each other in a tournament to determine a class ranking; grades were assigned accordingly.

Each student group wrote a Minimax and AlphaBeta version for submission, which was controlled by a java program written by the professor. The full code base is included here - the AI modules will not operate without a framework. Only the *_MatthewMartin.java files (and Project2.pdf writeup) were written by me.
